### 1. Install node

See https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Note: Unlike with Mac and Windows, Node does not provide a linux installer. I
recommend using a package manager as instructed here:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

This should put the commands `node` and `npm` on your path so you can use them in the terminal.

### 2. Install bower

`bower` is an npm package that you install like so:

```bash
npm install --global bower
```

This should put `bower` on your path so you can use it in the terminal
